<h1>Face mask detection by using Machine Learning</h1><br>
<p>Hi, this project has been made as a part of my minor project. By using this we can detect if the person(s) in the image or a webcam are wearing face masks or not. To use this just clone the repository and ensure python3 is installed in the machine, then run pip install requirements.txt, then download the image dataset from kaggle and put it in correct directory as used in the python script then launch the script train_mask_detector.py to train the model, and finally after the model is trained then launch detect_mask_video.py to detect the mask in webcam and detect_mask_image.py -i (image path) to detect mask in image.</p>
